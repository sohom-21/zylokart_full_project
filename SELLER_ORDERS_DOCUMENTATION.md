   - `product_id`: Foreign key to Products table
   - `quantity`: Number of items ordered
   - `total_price`: Total amount for the order
   - `status`: Order status (pending, processing, delivered, cancelled)
   - `created_at`: Order creation timestamp

2. **Products Table**: Product information
   - `id`: Primary key
   - `seller_id`: Foreign key to Sellers table
   - `name`: Product name
   - `image_url`: Product image
   - `price`: Original price

## Files Created/Modified

### New File: `seller-orders.js`
**Location**: `src/app/utiils/supabase/seller-orders.js`

**Functions Implemented**:
- `getSellerOrdersWithDetails()`: Fetch orders with complete product and customer details
- `getSellerOrdersByStatus()`: Filter orders by status
- `updateSellerOrderStatus()`: Update order status (syncs with customer view)
- `getSellerOrderStats()`: Calculate statistics for dashboard
- `bulkUpdateOrderStatus()`: Update multiple orders at once
- `searchSellerOrders()`: Search orders by multiple criteria
- `getSellerOrdersByDateRange()`: Filter orders by date range

### Modified File: `page.js`
**Location**: `src/app/seller/Orders/page.js`

**Key Improvements**:
- Complete UI overhaul with modern design
- Integration with new seller-orders functions
- Real-time status updates
- Advanced search and filtering
- Statistics dashboard
- Responsive layout
- Loading states and error handling

## How It Works

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Gets the current user from localStorage
- Fetches seller details using `getSellerByUserId()`
- Only allows access to registered sellers

### 2. Data Fetching
- Uses complex JOIN queries to fetch orders with:
  - Product details (name, image, price, category)
  - Customer details (name, email, phone)
  - Order details (quantity, total, status, date)
- Filters orders to show only those for the seller's products

### 3. Status Management
- Sellers can change order status via dropdown
- Updates are immediately reflected in the database
- Changes sync with customer order views
- Statistics are recalculated after each update

### 4. Search & Filtering
- Real-time search across multiple fields
- Status-based filtering
- Maintains state across user interactions
